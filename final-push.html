      <h1>Final Push</h1>
      <p>September 12th, 2021</p>
      <p>
        It has been 3 years (almost to the day, as I write this) since I’ve
        begun the transition from filmmaking to software engineering as a way to
        make a living. I left my last gig on a television show in Boston to
        drive across the country and learn how to program in Silicon Valley.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned so much at that school. I met wonderful people that I’ve kept
        in touch with to this day. I learned how to think critically as a
        programmer, how to break down large problems, how to be patient, how to
        use google effectively, and how to pace myself. The lab was the place to
        be- full of fellow cadets and developers who were all trying to do the
        same things. It was a wonderful mecca of different personalities.
        However different we all were, no matter where we came from, no matter
        how old we were- we all loved to code. Looking back on my time there
        now, it was awesome.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal was to stay at this school until I’d secured a position as an
        engineer in the bay area. There was one year from February 2019 to
        around March 2020 filled with tons of programming and exploration in
        that awesome environment. However, by the time coronavirus had entered
        the picture, my programming journey was siloed off. Everyone on campus
        was encouraged to leave if they could. I went to stay with family for 5
        months until I returned to a shell of a former school in August 2020.
      </p>
      <p>
        The school eventually closed in November 2020 and I moved to another
        state where it was cheaper to live and I could continue my job search. I
        continued to try and learn but I drifted with the pressures of bills and
        loan payments. I couldn’t seem to focus without a safety net and so I
        found a full-time job. Programming kind of fell on the backburner and it
        seemed like I was back to where I started.
      </p>
      <p>
        I recently signed up for another programming school that is entirely
        remote. I resisted the idea initially because I didn’t want to pay for
        more schooling but it wasn’t until recently that I’d come around to
        accepting the fact that I needed structure. I wanted mentorship and
        access to other students working towards the same goals. I wanted career
        counseling- essentially, someone to guide me through the job search
        process. I needed a fire. Identifying and accepting that reality helped
        me break out of my programming rut.
      </p>
      <p>
        This week was my first week within the curriculum. There wasn’t much
        coding involved but I did manage to quickly complete some introductory
        exercises. My time in Silicon Valley was definitely not wasted. I can’t
        imagine starting this curriculum with ZERO coding experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had a call with my mentor this afternoon and he was really cool. He
        gave a lot of advice regarding how I should approach things and it left
        me excited for the next couple months. I’m excited to be consistent, to
        be coding again everyday and to create the things that I want to create.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m seeing this moment as the final push towards what I’d set out to do
        3 years ago. So much has changed since then. I’ve literally become a
        different person, mentally, physically, professionally and spiritually.
        It’s been a journey and it feels amazing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m writing this post in the hopes of chronicling this journey. I also
        plan on building out features to this personal site in an effort to add
        something to my portfolio outside of the bootcamp’s portfolio projects.
        I plan on having a blog and a podcast in the future. These posts are my
        attempts at exploring that practice that aligns with my studies as well
        as my interests. I’ll eventually start a mailing list with blog
        features.
      </p>
      <p>I can’t wait to read this again next year!</p>
